### Description

This is a website for an imagined social media platform called Pawfinity. Designing and creating it was a course assignment for the front-end course at Noroff School of technology and digital media

The website includes these features:

- User with @noroff.no or @stud.noroff.no email can register profile
- Registered user can login
- User can view a post content feed
- User can filter the post content feed
- User can search the post content feed
- User can view a post content item by ID
- User can create a post content item
- User can update a post content item
- User can delete a post content item

I have used Trello to manage the development tasks. Here is a link to the trello board:
